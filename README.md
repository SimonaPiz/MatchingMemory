## General Information
In this project, I build a React web application. 
I use my knowledge of React components, passing state with React-Redux to build a web app that allows users to:

- [x] set new game with random cards
- [x] flip card
- [x] reset card
- [x] win if it reaches the total result

### main Tasks
- Provide the Redux Store
- Create the Board Layout
- Show Cards
- Initialize the Game
- Flipping Cards
- Reset the Flipped Cards
- Matching Cards
- Get the Score
- extra: use green and red to the text of cards that are flipped over and matched/not matched

## Technologies Used
- React 18
- React-Redux 7
- Node.js 18

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../[directory]
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
